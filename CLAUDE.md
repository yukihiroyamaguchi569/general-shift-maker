- ### 1. Think Before Coding

  

  **Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

  LLMs often pick an interpretation silently and run with it. This principle forces explicit reasoning:

  - **State assumptions explicitly** — If uncertain, ask rather than guess
  - **Present multiple interpretations** — Don't pick silently when ambiguity exists
  - **Push back when warranted** — If a simpler approach exists, say so
  - **Stop when confused** — Name what's unclear and ask for clarification

  ### 2. Simplicity First

  

  **Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

  Combat the tendency toward overengineering:

  - No features beyond what was asked
  - No abstractions for single-use code
  - No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested
  - No error handling for impossible scenarios
  - If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it

  **The test:** Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

  ### 3. Surgical Changes

  

  **Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

  When editing existing code:

  - Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting
  - Don't refactor things that aren't broken
  - Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently
  - If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it

  When your changes create orphans:

  - Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused
  - Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked

  **The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

  ### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

  

  **Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

  Transform imperative tasks into verifiable goals:

  | Instead of...    | Transform to...                                       |
  | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | "Add validation" | "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass" |
  | "Fix the bug"    | "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"  |
  | "Refactor X"     | "Ensure tests pass before and after"                  |

  For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

  ```
  1. [Step] → verify: [check]
  2. [Step] → verify: [check]
  3. [Step] → verify: [check]
  ```

  

  Strong success criteria let the LLM loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
